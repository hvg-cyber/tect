This program demonstrates how the following commands are implemented:
workbench.action.moveEditorToNewWindow
workbench.action.moveEditorGroupToNewWindow
workbench.action.copyEditorToNewWindow
workbench.action.copyEditorGroupToNewWindow


Bug: 'workbench.action.moveEditorToNewWindow'
moves the stuff into an auxiliary window.
This does not seem right.
And it does not work in web at all.
